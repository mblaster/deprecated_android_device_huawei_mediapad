Cyanogenmod9 device tree for the Huawei Mediapad
(Based on pyramid device tree from zyonee)

WIP: CURRENTLY ONLY RECOVERY WORKS PARTIALLY

Howto build recovery in a nutshell:

1) Set up your CM9 tree
2) Chek out this repository to device/huawei/mediapad
3) . build/envsetup.sh
4) . build/tools/device/makerecoveries.sh full_mediapad-eng

Then flash it using $fastboot flash recovery $CM9DIR/out/target/product/mediapad/recovery.img

GPL notice for kernel source code: Afaik Huawei has not released it yet, as they are obliged to do. Please drop me a note if you know where to get it. As soon as I have it myself I will link to it here.

Happy coding
